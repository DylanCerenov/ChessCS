changed isInCheck to setCheck
created returnCheck()
created inCheck variable

so where im at rn 9;08 pm 3/20/2020 is that i changed how the check is stored.
now im testing pieces on if they can move if the king is in chess

I still have to test whether the program  stops someone from moving if their king is in check and in danger
            and their move doesnt save the king


b6 b5
f6 e4

a piece cant move if it leaves the king in check


d2 d4
e7 e6
c2 c3
e6 e5
d4 e5
a7 a6
c1 d2
d8 h4
f2 f3


TODO: make sure pieces can't move if their king is in check, unless it saves the king
and make sure that pieces cant move if the resulting move leaves the king in check.
